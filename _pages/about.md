I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute](https://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. I work with [Dr. Michael Silver](https://argentum.ucbso.berkeley.edu/) and [Dr. Jack Gallant](https://gallantlab.github.io/) to investigate how psilocybin changes visual and semantic brain representations using fMRI and computational models.
