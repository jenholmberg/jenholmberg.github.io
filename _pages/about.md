Hi, I'm Jen. I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the [Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute](https://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. I work with [Dr. Michael Silver](https://argentum.ucbso.berkeley.edu/) and [Dr. Jack Gallant](https://www.gallantlab.org) to investigate how psilocybin changes visual and semantic brain representations using fMRI and voxelwise modeling. You will eventually be able to read about my research [here](https://jenholmberg.github.io/research/) -- stay tuned. 
  
    
I also co-lead a psychedelic neuroscience journal club and volunteer with the Harm Reduction Expansion Project on campus. In my free time I like to hang out with my cat, [draw](https://www.instagram.com/glitterphysics/), and be outside. Please reach out via email or twitter if you're interested in connecting!
