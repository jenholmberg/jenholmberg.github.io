I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the [Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute](https://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley.  
I work with [Dr. Michael Silver](https://argentum.ucbso.berkeley.edu/) and [Dr. Jack Gallant](https://www.gallantlab.org) to investigate how psilocybin changes visual and semantic brain representations using fMRI and voxelwise modeling.  
You will eventually be able to read about my research [here](https://jenholmberg.github.io/research/) -- stay tuned.  
Please reach out via email if you're interested in connecting!
